## 1. mv_balance_amount_summary

### Purpose
Pre-computed balance amount aggregations for sub-second report performance

### Business Scenarios Supported
✅ **PASS Scenarios:**
- Claims with single submission and single remittance
- Claims with multiple remittances (aggregated correctly)
- Claims with resubmissions and subsequent remittances
- Claims with partial payments and denials
- Claims with no remittance data (pending claims)
- Claims with encounter data and facility information
- Claims with status timeline tracking

❌ **FAIL Scenarios:**
- Claims with corrupted claim_key_id relationships
- Claims with invalid reference data (payer_ref_id, provider_ref_id)
- Claims with missing encounter data (will show NULL facility info)
- Claims with malformed status timeline data

### Data Requirements
**Core Tables:**
- `claims.claim_key` (spine table)
- `claims.claim` (submission data)
- `claims.claim_status_timeline` (status tracking)
- `claims.remittance_claim` + `claims.remittance_activity` (remittance data)
- `claims.claim_event` (resubmission tracking)
- `claims.encounter` (facility data)
- `claims_ref.provider`, `claims_ref.payer`, `claims_ref.facility` (reference data)

**Key Relationships:**
- `claim.claim_key_id = claim_key.id` (spine connection)
- `remittance_claim.claim_key_id = claim_key.id` (remittance connection)
- `encounter.claim_id = claim.id` (encounter connection)

### Edge Cases & Potential Issues
1. **Multiple Remittances**: ✅ Handled via aggregation CTE
2. **Missing Encounter Data**: ⚠️ Will show NULL facility_id, facility_name
3. **Orphaned Reference Data**: ⚠️ Will show NULL provider_name, payer_name
4. **Status Timeline Gaps**: ⚠️ Will show NULL current_status, last_status_date
5. **Future-Dated Claims**: ⚠️ Claims with future encounter_start dates will show negative aging_days and appear in future month buckets, distorting reporting metrics
6. **Currency Precision**: ⚠️ pending_amount calculation may have rounding issues

### Performance Characteristics
- **Index Strategy**: Unique index on claim_key_id, covering indexes for common filters
- **Refresh Time**: 2-5 minutes for full refresh
- **Storage**: ~500MB-1GB depending on claim volume

### Edge Cases & Potential Issues
1. **Multiple Remittances per Claim**: ✅ Handled via claim_remittance_agg CTE
2. **No Remittance Data**: ❌ Excluded by `WHERE cra.claim_key_id IS NOT NULL` - claims without remittance data are completely excluded from this MV
3. **Payment Reference Conflicts**: ⚠️ Uses latest payment_reference, may not reflect all cycles
4. **Denial Code Aggregation**: ⚠️ STRING_AGG may truncate if too many codes
5. **Collection Rate Division by Zero**: ✅ Protected by CASE statement
6. **Settlement Date Inconsistencies**: ⚠️ Uses latest settlement date, may not reflect payment timing
7. **Future-Dated Remittances**: ⚠️ Claims with future settlement dates will appear in future month buckets

### Edge Cases & Potential Issues
1. **Missing Clinician Data**: ❌ Excluded by `WHERE cl.id IS NOT NULL` - claims without clinician data are completely excluded
2. **Missing Facility Data**: ❌ Excluded by `WHERE f.facility_code IS NOT NULL` - claims without facility data are completely excluded
3. **Multiple Activities per Claim**: ⚠️ May inflate claim counts if not properly aggregated
4. **Remittance Aggregation**: ✅ Handled via remittance_aggregated CTE
5. **Monthly Bucketing**: ⚠️ Uses remittance date, may not align with submission month
6. **Percentage Calculations**: ✅ Protected against division by zero

3. **Negative Amounts**: ⚠️ Will be included in aggregations (may be intentional)
4. **NULL Payer/Provider**: ⚠️ Will create separate NULL groups
5. **Duplicate Member IDs**: ⚠️ COUNT(DISTINCT) handles this correctly

## Overall System Analysis

### Common Success Patterns
1. **Aggregation CTEs**: All MVs use CTEs to pre-aggregate one-to-many relationships
2. **Spine Table Usage**: All MVs use `claim_key` as the central spine table
3. **Reference Data Handling**: All MVs use LEFT JOINs for reference data with COALESCE fallbacks
4. **Unique Indexes**: All MVs have unique indexes for concurrent refresh capability

### Common Failure Patterns
1. **Missing Data Exclusion**: Several MVs exclude records with missing data via WHERE clauses
2. **Hardcoded Values**: Some MVs use hardcoded checks (e.g., 'Self-Paid') that may not be flexible
3. **Complex Logic**: Some MVs have complex business logic that may not cover all edge cases
4. **Date Handling**: Some MVs use different date fields for bucketing, which may cause inconsistencies

### Recommendations
1. **Data Quality**: Implement data quality checks before MV refresh
2. **Monitoring**: Add monitoring for MV refresh failures and data anomalies
3. **Testing**: Create comprehensive test cases for each MV covering edge cases
4. **Documentation**: Maintain detailed documentation of business logic and assumptions
5. **Performance**: Monitor MV refresh times and storage growth over time

## Critical Edge Cases Deep Dive

### Future-Dated Claims Explained

**What are Future-Dated Claims?**
Future-dated claims are claims with transaction dates, encounter dates, or settlement dates that are in the future relative to the current system date.

**Types of Future-Dated Claims:**
1. **Future Submission Dates**: `claim.tx_at > CURRENT_DATE`
2. **Future Encounter Dates**: `encounter.start_at > CURRENT_DATE`
3. **Future Remittance Dates**: `remittance_claim.date_settlement > CURRENT_DATE`
4. **Future Event Dates**: `claim_event.event_time > CURRENT_DATE`

**Business Impact:**
- **Reporting Distortion**: Future-dated claims appear in future month buckets, creating empty future buckets and distorting current month metrics
- **Aging Calculations**: Negative aging days for future encounters (e.g., -30 days for an encounter 30 days in the future)
- **Performance Issues**: MVs may not optimize correctly for future data, affecting query performance
- **Business Logic**: Collection rates, rejection percentages, and other metrics may be skewed

**Example Scenario:**
```sql
-- A claim submitted on 2025-01-03 with encounter date 2025-02-15
-- Will show: aging_days = -43 (negative aging)
-- Will appear in: February 2025 month bucket instead of January 2025
```

### Cycle Limitations Explained

**Why Cycle Limitations Exist:**
The MVs are limited to tracking up to 5 resubmission/remittance cycles due to:

1. **Performance Considerations**: Unlimited cycles would create massive Cartesian products
   - 5 cycles = 5^2 = 25 combinations per claim
   - 10 cycles = 10^2 = 100 combinations per claim
   - Exponential growth in query complexity and execution time

2. **Storage Constraints**: More cycles = exponentially more storage
   - Each additional cycle requires additional columns
   - Index size grows with number of cycle columns
   - MV refresh time increases with cycle complexity

3. **Business Requirements**: Most claims don't exceed 5 cycles
   - Typical claim lifecycle: 1-3 cycles
   - Complex claims: 4-5 cycles
   - Exceptional cases: >5 cycles (rare)

4. **Query Complexity**: Unlimited cycles would make queries extremely complex
   - Dynamic column generation required
   - Complex aggregation logic
   - Difficult to maintain and debug

**Business Impact of Cycle Limitations:**
1. **Data Loss**: Claims with >5 cycles lose historical tracking data
2. **Reporting Gaps**: Incomplete resubmission/remittance history
3. **Business Intelligence**: Limited insights into complex claim lifecycles
4. **Audit Trail**: Incomplete audit trail for highly complex claims

**Example Scenario:**
```sql
-- A claim with 8 resubmission cycles
-- MV will track: first_resubmission, second_resubmission, third_resubmission, fourth_resubmission, fifth_resubmission
-- MV will lose: sixth_resubmission, seventh_resubmission, eighth_resubmission
-- Impact: 37.5% of resubmission history is lost
```

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Summary Aggregation**: Track total cycles beyond the limit
2. **Alternative Reporting**: Create separate reports for high-cycle claims
3. **Business Rules**: Define maximum acceptable cycles per claim type
4. **Dynamic Configuration**: Implement configurable cycle limits
