## üìã Report Overview

### Basic Information
- **Report Name**: Rejected Claims Report
- **Business Purpose**: Comprehensive analysis and tracking of rejected healthcare claims to identify patterns, improve claim processing efficiency, and reduce denial rates
- **Target Audience**: Healthcare administrators, billing managers, quality assurance teams, and payer relations staff
- **Frequency**: Daily, weekly, monthly, or on-demand
- **Created By**: Claims Processing System Team
- **Created Date**: 2025-09-24
- **Last Updated**: 2025-09-24

### Report Description
The Rejected Claims Report provides three complementary views for comprehensive analysis of rejected healthcare claims. It enables healthcare organizations to identify denial patterns, track rejection rates by facility and payer, analyze denial reasons, and monitor the effectiveness of resubmission efforts. The report supports both summary-level analysis for management reporting and detailed claim-level analysis for operational improvements.

## üìä Report Structure

### Tabs/Sections
1. **Tab A - Rejected Claims**: Summary-level view with expandable sub-data showing facility, payer, and claim-level rejection information
2. **Tab B - Receiver and Payer wise**: Analysis by receiver and payer combinations with aggregated metrics and performance indicators
3. **Tab C - Claim wise**: Individual claim details with comprehensive rejection information, denial codes, and audit trails

### Key Metrics
| Metric Name | Description | Calculation | Business Impact |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Rejection Rate (Remittance) | Percentage of rejected claims among remitted claims | `(rejected_claims / remitted_claims) * 100` | Measures payer-specific rejection patterns |
| Rejection Rate (Submission) | Percentage of rejected claims among all submissions | `(rejected_claims / total_claims) * 100` | Overall rejection performance |
| Average Claim Value | Mean claim amount for rejected claims | `SUM(claim_amount) / COUNT(claims)` | Financial impact analysis |
| Collection Rate | Percentage of billed amount that was collected | `(remitted_amount / billed_amount) * 100` | Revenue recovery efficiency |
| Aging Days | Days between service date and current date | `CURRENT_DATE - service_date` | Identifies delayed processing |

## üîç Field Mappings

### Business Fields to Database Fields
| Business Field | Database Field | Source Table | Notes |
|----------------|----------------|--------------|-------|
| FacilityGroup | `facility_group_id` | `encounter.facility_id` or `claim.provider_id` | Uses facility_id preferred, provider_id fallback |
| HealthAuthority | `sender_id`/`receiver_id` | `ingestion_file` | Submission sender, remittance receiver |
| FacilityID | `facility_id` | `encounter` | Direct mapping to encounter facility |
| Facility_Name | `name` | `claims_ref.facility` | Lookup via facility_code |
| Receiver_Name | `name` | `claims_ref.payer` | Lookup via receiver_id |
| Payer_Name | `name` | `claims_ref.payer` | Lookup via payer_id |
| Clinician_Name | `name` | `claims_ref.clinician` | Lookup via clinician_code |
| RejectionType | `rejection_type` | Calculated | Derived from payment_amount vs net |
| DenialCode | `denial_code` | `remittance_activity` | Direct mapping from remittance |
| DenialType | `description` | `claims_ref.denial_code` | Lookup via denial_code |
| ClaimAmt | `initial_net_amount` | `claim` | Billed amount from submission |
| RemittedAmt | `payment_amount` | `remittance_activity` | Paid amount from remittance |
| RejectedAmt | `rejected_amount` | Calculated | `net - payment_amount` for rejected portions |

### Calculated Fields
| Field Name | Calculation | Business Logic |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| RejectionType | `CASE WHEN payment_amount = 0 THEN 'Fully Rejected' WHEN payment_amount < net THEN 'Partially Rejected' WHEN payment_amount = net THEN 'Fully Paid' ELSE 'Unknown Status' END` | Determines rejection status based on payment amount |
| RejectedAmount | `CASE WHEN payment_amount = 0 THEN net WHEN payment_amount < net THEN net - payment_amount ELSE 0 END` | Calculates the rejected portion of the claim |
| RejectionPercentage | `(rejected_claims / total_claims) * 100` | Percentage of claims that were rejected |
| AgeingDays | `CURRENT_DATE - DATE(service_date)` | Days since service was provided |
| CollectionRate | `(remitted_amount / billed_amount) * 100` | Percentage of billed amount collected |

---

## üßÆ Business Logic

### Key Calculations
1. **Rejection Type Determination**:
   ```sql
   CASE 
     WHEN ra.payment_amount = 0 THEN 'Fully Rejected'
     WHEN ra.payment_amount < ra.net THEN 'Partially Rejected'
     WHEN ra.payment_amount = ra.net THEN 'Fully Paid'
     ELSE 'Unknown Status'
   END AS rejection_type
   ```
   - **Purpose**: Categorizes claims based on payment status
   - **Business Rules**: Zero payment = fully rejected, partial payment = partially rejected, full payment = fully paid

2. **Rejection Amount Calculation**:
   ```sql
   CASE 
     WHEN ra.payment_amount = 0 THEN ra.net
     WHEN ra.payment_amount < ra.net THEN ra.net - ra.payment_amount
     ELSE 0
   END AS rejected_amount
   ```
   - **Purpose**: Calculates the financial impact of rejections
   - **Business Rules**: For fully rejected claims, entire amount is rejected; for partial rejections, difference is rejected

3. **Rejection Percentage Calculation**:
   ```sql
   CASE 
     WHEN COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN rcb.activity_payment_amount > 0 THEN rcb.claim_key_id END) > 0 
     THEN ROUND(
       (COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN rcb.rejected_amount > 0 THEN rcb.claim_key_id END)::NUMERIC / 
        COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN rcb.activity_payment_amount > 0 THEN rcb.claim_key_id END)) * 100, 2
     )
     ELSE 0 
   END AS rejected_percentage_based_on_remittance
   ```
   - **Purpose**: Calculates rejection rate as percentage of remitted claims
   - **Business Rules**: Only considers claims that have been processed (remitted)

### Filtering Logic
| Filter | Logic | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Rejection Filter | `WHERE (ra.denial_code IS NOT NULL OR (ra.payment_amount IS NOT NULL AND ra.payment_amount < ra.net) OR (ra.payment_amount IS NOT NULL AND ra.payment_amount = 0))` | Only includes claims with some form of rejection |
| Date Range Filter | `WHERE activity_start_date >= p_date_from AND activity_start_date <= p_date_to` | Limits data to specified date range |
| Facility Filter | `WHERE facility_id = ANY(p_facility_codes)` | Filters by specific facilities |
| Payer Filter | `WHERE payer_id = ANY(p_payer_codes)` | Filters by specific payers |

### Status Mappings
| Status Code | Status Text | Description |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | Submitted | Claim has been submitted but not yet processed |
| 2 | Resubmitted | Claim has been resubmitted after initial rejection |
| 3 | Remitted | Claim has been processed and remittance received |
| 4 | Partially Paid | Claim has been partially paid |
| 5 | Fully Rejected | Claim has been completely rejected |
| 6 | Partially Rejected | Claim has been partially rejected |

## üîß Performance Considerations

### Indexes
| Index Name | Table | Columns | Purpose |
|------------|-------|---------|---------|
| `idx_remittance_activity_denial_code` | `remittance_activity` | `denial_code` | Fast lookup of denied activities |
| `idx_remittance_activity_payment_amount` | `remittance_activity` | `payment_amount` | Filtering by payment status |
| `idx_remittance_activity_rejection` | `remittance_activity` | `remittance_claim_id` | Rejection analysis |
| `idx_encounter_facility_id` | `encounter` | `facility_id` | Facility-based filtering |
| `idx_claim_payer_id` | `claim` | `payer_id` | Payer-based filtering |
| `idx_ingestion_file_receiver_id` | `ingestion_file` | `receiver_id` | Receiver-based filtering |
| `idx_encounter_start_at` | `encounter` | `start_at` | Date-based filtering |
| `idx_remittance_claim_date_settlement` | `remittance_claim` | `date_settlement` | Settlement date filtering |

### Performance Tips
1. **Date Filtering**: Always use date filters to limit data volume
2. **Facility Filtering**: Use facility codes when possible for better performance
3. **Pagination**: Use LIMIT and OFFSET for large result sets
4. **Index Usage**: Monitor index usage with `pg_stat_user_indexes`
5. **Denial Code Filtering**: Use specific denial codes when analyzing rejection reasons

### Expected Performance
- **Small Dataset** (< 1K records): < 1 second
- **Medium Dataset** (1K-10K records): 1-5 seconds
- **Large Dataset** (10K-100K records): 5-15 seconds
- **Very Large Dataset** (> 100K records): 15-30 seconds
