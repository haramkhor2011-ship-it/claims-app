-- REPORT VIEWS - SQL VIEWS FOR REPORTS
-- ==========================================================================================================
-- 
-- Purpose: Create SQL views for reports (if needed)
-- Version: 1.0
-- Date: 2025-01-15
-- 
-- This script creates SQL views for reports that are not covered by materialized views.
-- Most reports use materialized views for performance, but some may need dynamic views.
--
-- ==========================================================================================================

-- Note: In addition to materialized views, we keep traditional SQL views and API functions here
-- where they provide convenience or dynamic behavior. Extracted from report implementations.

-- ==========================================================================================================
-- BALANCE AMOUNT REPORT â€“ BASE VIEW AND TABS
