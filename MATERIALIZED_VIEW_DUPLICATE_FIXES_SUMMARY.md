# Materialized View Duplicate Fixes Summary

## Problem Identified

The materialized views `mv_claim_summary_payerwise` and `mv_claim_summary_encounterwise` were experiencing duplicate key violations during refresh due to multiple remittances per claim creating multiple rows through LEFT JOINs.

### Root Cause
```sql
-- PROBLEMATIC PATTERN (caused duplicates):
LEFT JOIN claims.remittance_claim rc ON rc.claim_key_id = ck.id
LEFT JOIN claims.remittance_activity ra ON ra.remittance_claim_id = rc.id
```

When a claim has multiple remittances (submission → remittance → resubmission → remittance), this pattern creates multiple rows for the same claim, violating unique constraints.

## Solution Applied

### Approach: Pre-aggregate Remittance Data
Added a `remittance_aggregated` CTE to pre-aggregate all remittance data per `claim_key_id` before joining, ensuring one row per claim.

### Changes Made

#### 1. mv_claim_summary_payerwise (Lines 947-1058)
- **ADDED**: `remittance_aggregated` CTE (lines 949-969)
- **CHANGED**: Direct LEFT JOINs replaced with aggregated CTE
- **FIXED**: Duplicate key violations by ensuring one row per `(month_bucket, payer_id, facility_id)`
- **IMPROVED**: Payer information now uses latest remittance payer as primary source

#### 2. mv_claim_summary_encounterwise (Lines 1063-1179)
- **ADDED**: Same `remittance_aggregated` CTE pattern as payerwise
- **CHANGED**: Direct LEFT JOINs replaced with aggregated CTE
- **FIXED**: Duplicate key violations by ensuring one row per `(month_bucket, encounter_type, facility_id, payer_id)`
- **IMPROVED**: Payer information now uses latest remittance payer as primary source

### Key Features of the Fix

1. **Aggregation Logic**:
   ```sql
   WITH remittance_aggregated AS (
     SELECT 
       rc.claim_key_id,
       COUNT(*) as remittance_count,
       SUM(ra.payment_amount) as total_payment_amount,
       SUM(ra.net) as total_remitted_amount,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN ra.payment_amount > 0 THEN 1 END) as paid_activity_count,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN ra.payment_amount > 0 AND ra.payment_amount < ra.net THEN 1 END) as partially_paid_activity_count,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN ra.payment_amount = 0 OR ra.denial_code IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as rejected_activity_count,
       -- ... other aggregations
       MIN(rc.date_settlement) as first_remittance_date,
       MAX(rc.date_settlement) as last_remittance_date,
       -- Use the most recent remittance for payer/provider info
       (ARRAY_AGG(rc.id_payer ORDER BY rc.date_settlement DESC NULLS LAST))[1] as latest_id_payer
     FROM claims.remittance_claim rc
     LEFT JOIN claims.remittance_activity ra ON ra.remittance_claim_id = rc.id
     GROUP BY rc.claim_key_id
   )
   ```

2. **Payer Information Priority**:
   - Primary: Latest remittance payer (`ra.latest_id_payer`)
   - Fallback: Submission payer (`c.id_payer`)
   - Default: 'Unknown'

3. **Date Logic**:
   - Uses `ra.last_remittance_date` for month bucketing
   - Falls back to `c.tx_at` for claims without remittances

## Files Modified

1. **src/main/resources/db/reports_sql/sub_second_materialized_views.sql**
   - Fixed `mv_claim_summary_payerwise` (lines 947-1058)
   - Fixed `mv_claim_summary_encounterwise` (lines 1063-1179)
   - Updated comments to reflect fixes

2. **Created Supporting Files**:
   - `fix_materialized_views_duplicates.sql` - Standalone fix script
   - `run_mv_fix.ps1` - PowerShell execution script

   - `src/main/java/com/acme/claims/MaterializedViewFixRunner.java` - Spring Boot runner

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check Row Counts
```sql
SELECT 'mv_claim_summary_payerwise' as view_name, COUNT(*) as row_count 
FROM claims.mv_claim_summary_payerwise
UNION ALL 
SELECT 'mv_claim_summary_encounterwise', COUNT(*) 
FROM claims.mv_claim_summary_encounterwise
ORDER BY view_name;
```

### 2. Check for Duplicates
```sql
SELECT 
  'mv_claim_summary_payerwise' as view_name,
  COUNT(*) as total_rows,
  COUNT(DISTINCT month_bucket, payer_id, facility_id) as unique_keys,
  COUNT(*) - COUNT(DISTINCT month_bucket, payer_id, facility_id) as duplicates
FROM claims.mv_claim_summary_payerwise
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'mv_claim_summary_encounterwise',
  COUNT(*),
  COUNT(DISTINCT month_bucket, encounter_type, facility_id, payer_id),
  COUNT(*) - COUNT(DISTINCT month_bucket, encounter_type, facility_id, payer_id)
FROM claims.mv_claim_summary_encounterwise;
```

### 3. Test Refresh
```sql
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW claims.mv_claim_summary_payerwise;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW claims.mv_claim_summary_encounterwise;
```

## Expected Results

- **No duplicate key violations** during refresh
- **One row per unique key** in both materialized views
- **Preserved business logic** with aggregated remittance data
- **Sub-second performance** maintained for reports

## Next Steps

1. **Test the fixes** by running the verification queries
2. **Refresh the materialized views** to populate with fixed data
3. **Test reports** to ensure they work correctly
4. **Monitor performance** to ensure sub-second response times
5. **Fix remaining views** if needed:
   - `mv_doctor_denial_summary`
   - `mv_claim_details_complete`
   - `mv_remittances_resubmission_activity_level`
   - `mv_rejected_claims_summary`

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Impacts

- ✅ Preserves sub-second performance targets
- ✅ Follows claim lifecycle principles
- ✅ Uses latest remittance data as primary source

### Considerations
- ⚠️ Slightly more complex queries due to CTEs
- ⚠️ Requires testing to ensure report accuracy
- ⚠️ May need similar fixes for other materialized views

## Documentation Updates
