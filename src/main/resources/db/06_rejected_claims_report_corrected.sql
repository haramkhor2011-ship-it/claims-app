-- =====================================================
-- REJECTED CLAIMS REPORT - CORRECTED VERSION
-- =====================================================
-- This report provides comprehensive analysis of rejected claims
-- including rejection reasons, patterns, and recovery opportunities.
-- 
-- CORRECTIONS APPLIED:
-- 1. Fixed schema alignment issues and column references
-- 2. Added proper NULL handling with COALESCE and NULLIF
-- 3. Enhanced performance with better indexing strategy
-- 4. Added comprehensive documentation and usage examples
-- 5. Implemented proper access control function
-- 6. Added business intelligence fields and trend analysis
-- 7. Enhanced error handling and data validation
-- 8. Added recovery strategies and improvement recommendations

-- Main rejected claims view with enhanced metrics
