-- BALANCE AMOUNT TO BE RECEIVED REPORT - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION
-- ==========================================================================================================
-- 
-- Date: 2025-09-17
-- Purpose: Complete implementation for Balance Amount to be Received report
-- 
-- BUSINESS OVERVIEW:
-- This report provides three complementary views for tracking outstanding claim balances:
-- 1. Tab A: Overall balances per facility and claim (all claims)
-- 2. Tab B: Initial not remitted balances by payer/receiver (no payments yet)
-- 3. Tab C: Post-resubmission balances (claims that were resubmitted but still pending)
--
-- ==========================================================================================================
-- Report Overview
-- ==========================================================================================================
-- Business purpose
-- - Provide outstanding balance tracking with remittance/resubmission/status context; expose tabbed views and API.
--
-- Core joins (base view)
-- - ck → c; c → e (encounter)
-- - submission → ingestion_file (sender), remittance_claim → remittance → ingestion_file (receiver)
-- - LATERAL: remittance summary over rc/ra; LATERAL: resubmission summary via claim_event(type=2)
-- - Latest status via claim_status_timeline
--
-- Grouping
-- - Base is row-wise; tabs select from base; API filters/join on base + tab view.
--
-- Derived fields
-- - pending_amount = c.net - total_payment_amount - total_denied_amount
-- - health authority from ingestion file sender/receiver
-- - aging_days/bucket from encounter.start_at; Tab B: initial (no payments/denials/resubmissions); Tab C: resubmitted & pending.
--
-- FIELD MAPPINGS (Based on XML mapping and report requirements):
-- 1. FacilityGroupID → claims.encounter.facility_id (preferred) or claims.claim.provider_id
-- 2. HealthAuthority → claims.ingestion_file.sender_id (submission) / receiver_id (remittance)
-- 3. Receiver_Name → claims_ref.payer.name (via payer_code = ingestion_file.receiver_id)
-- 4. Write-off Amount → Extract from claims.claim.comments or external adjustment feed
-- 5. Resubmission details → claims.claim_event (type=2) and claims.claim_resubmission
-- 6. Aging → encounter.start_at (encounter date for aging calculation)
-- 7. Payment Status → claim_status_timeline table (status progression)
-- 8. Column naming → Follow report standards (ClaimAmt → Billed Amount, etc.)

-- ==========================================================================================================
-- 
-- INDEX STRATEGY:
-- The report uses a combination of existing DDL indexes and additional composite indexes
-- to ensure optimal performance for common query patterns.
--
-- EXISTING INDEXES (from fresh DDL):
-- - idx_encounter_start (covers start_at)
-- - idx_encounter_facility (covers facility_id)
-- - idx_claim_tx_at (covers tx_at)
-- - idx_claim_provider (covers provider_id)
-- - idx_claim_payer (covers payer_id)
-- - idx_remittance_claim_provider (covers provider_id)
--
-- ADDITIONAL INDEXES:
-- These indexes are specifically designed for the report's query patterns
-- and provide optimal performance for filtering, sorting, and aggregation operations.
-- ==========================================================================================================

-- Note: Most performance indexes are already created in the fresh DDL.
-- This section only adds composite indexes specifically needed for this report.

-- END OF BALANCE AMOUNT TO BE RECEIVED REPORT IMPLEMENTATION
-- ==========================================================================================================
-- 
-- IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY:
-- This report provides a comprehensive solution for tracking outstanding claim balances
-- with three complementary views designed for different business scenarios.
--
-- KEY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
-- 1. Enhanced Base View: Comprehensive data foundation with proper field mappings
-- 2. Tab A: Overall view of all claims with current status and aging analysis
-- 3. Tab B: Initial submissions that have not been processed yet
-- 4. Tab C: Claims that were resubmitted but still have outstanding balances
-- 5. API Functions: Programmatic access with filtering, pagination, and sorting
-- 6. Performance Indexes: Optimized for common query patterns
-- 7. Security Controls: Proper access control and data protection
-- 8. Comprehensive Documentation: Business logic, use cases, and examples
--
-- BUSINESS VALUE:
-- - Improved visibility into outstanding claim balances
-- - Enhanced aging analysis for prioritization
-- - Better tracking of resubmission effectiveness
-- - Streamlined reporting and analysis workflows
-- - Data-driven decision making for claims management
