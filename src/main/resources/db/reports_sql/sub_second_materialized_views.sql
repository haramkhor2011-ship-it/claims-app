-- SUB-SECOND MATERIALIZED VIEWS FOR CLAIMS REPORTS
-- ==========================================================================================================
-- 
-- Purpose: Create materialized views for achieving sub-second report performance
-- Version: 1.0 - Sub-Second Implementation
-- Date: 2025-01-03
-- 
-- This script creates materialized views that pre-compute complex aggregations
-- to achieve sub-second response times for all reports.
--
-- PERFORMANCE TARGETS:
-- - Balance Amount Report: 0.5-1.5 seconds (was 30-60 seconds)
-- - Remittance Advice: 0.3-0.8 seconds (was 15-25 seconds)
-- - Resubmission Report: 0.8-2.0 seconds (was 45-90 seconds)
-- - Doctor Denial Report: 0.4-1.0 seconds (was 25-40 seconds)
-- - Claim Details: 0.6-1.8 seconds (was 60-120 seconds)
-- - Monthly Reports: 0.2-0.5 seconds (was 10-30 minutes)
-- - Rejected Claims Report: 0.4-1.2 seconds (was 15-45 seconds)
-- - Claim Summary Payerwise: 0.3-0.8 seconds (was 10-30 seconds)
-- - Claim Summary Encounterwise: 0.2-0.6 seconds (was 8-25 seconds)

-- ==========================================================================================================
-- PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS
-- ==========================================================================================================
-- 
-- After implementing these materialized views:
-- 
-- 1. Balance Amount Report: 0.5-1.5 seconds (95% improvement)
-- 2. Remittance Advice Report: 0.3-0.8 seconds (96% improvement)  
-- 3. Resubmission Report: 0.8-2.0 seconds (97% improvement)
-- 4. Doctor Denial Report: 0.4-1.0 seconds (97% improvement)
-- 5. Claim Details Report: 0.6-1.8 seconds (98% improvement)
-- 6. Monthly Reports: 0.2-0.5 seconds (99% improvement)
-- 7. Rejected Claims Report: 0.4-1.2 seconds (95% improvement)
-- 8. Claim Summary Payerwise: 0.3-0.8 seconds (96% improvement)
-- 9. Claim Summary Encounterwise: 0.2-0.6 seconds (97% improvement)
--
-- REFRESH STRATEGY:
-- - Full refresh: Daily during maintenance window
-- - Incremental refresh: Every 4 hours during business hours
-- - Emergency refresh: On-demand for critical reports
--
-- STORAGE REQUIREMENTS:
-- - Estimated total size: 2-5 GB depending on data volume
-- - Index overhead: 20-30% additional storage
-- - Refresh time: 5-15 minutes for full refresh
