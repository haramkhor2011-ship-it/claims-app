They vary according to whether the Encounter went past midnight, lasted for more than 24 hours, involved a hospital bed and whether they involved an emergency room. To benchmark with different countries, one needs to know, whether the patient was in the emergency room, and whether the patient occupied a hospital bed.
                -	Inpatient bed: A licensed bed approved by the competent authority which is assigned to a patient who is arriving to a health care facility for an emergent, urgent or elective/planned Encounter. Beds assigned temporarily for "holding" purposes in a no bed situation may be designated and included in hospital occupancy rate calculation (e.g. emergency room, recovery room). Only beds included in the licensed inpatient bed complement will be used for purposes of hospital occupancy rate calculation. Beds may have an associated accommodation value such as private (i.e. single bed/room) or shared (i.e. multiple beds/room).
                -	Beds included in the inpatient bed complement:
                -   Beds in general wards or units set up and staffed for inpatient services

                -	Daycase bed: Daycase beds, also known as observation beds, are beds used in Day Care units such as surgical, medical, paediatric day care interventional radiology. They are not included in the inpatient bed complement.

                -   The concatenation of all external provider invoice reference numbers sorted alphabetically and separated by '@'.
                -   Rationale: In some insurer-provider relationships, the provider does not record the insurer's Claims number (ClaimIDPayer) and the insurer does not record the provider's Claim number either (ClaimID).
                -   Financial transactions are instead communicated using the provider's invoice number.
                -   The only way to reconcile payments at the level of a Claim is to define a reference number ClaimIDInvoice by concatenating each of the provider external reference numbers on the invoices relating to the Claim.
                -   This creates a unique key for the Claim, which can be created independently by the provider as well as the insurer.
                -   It can thus be used to uniquely identify a Claim.
                -   Example 1: A provider submits a Claim to an insurer. The Claim has three invoices H00-1-op-017, H00-1-med-023, H00-2-sur-017. ClaimIDInvoice is "H00-1-med-023@H00-1-op-017@H00-2-sur-017"
                -   Example 2: A patient goes to a hospital, receives an invoice for his treatment, and pays out pocket. The invoice number is H23-07-09-11-0124. ClaimIDInvoice is "H23-07-09-11-0124"
                -   Example 3: A provider submits a Claim to an insurer. The Claim has only one invoice H001-1-op-984. ClaimIDInvoice is "H001-1-op-984"
