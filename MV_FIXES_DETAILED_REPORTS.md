## 1. mv_remittances_resubmission_activity_level

### **Report Purpose**
Activity-level report showing remittances and resubmissions with detailed financial tracking per activity.

### **Aggregations Applied**

#### **1. Resubmission Cycles Aggregation**
```sql
resubmission_cycles_aggregated AS (
    SELECT 
        ce.claim_key_id,
        (ARRAY_AGG(cr.resubmission_type ORDER BY ce.event_time))[1] as first_resubmission_type,
        (ARRAY_AGG(cr.comment ORDER BY ce.event_time))[1] as first_resubmission_comment,
        (ARRAY_AGG(ce.event_time ORDER BY ce.event_time))[1] as first_resubmission_date,
        -- ... up to 5 cycles
    FROM claims.claim_event ce
    LEFT JOIN claims.claim_resubmission cr ON ce.id = cr.claim_event_id
    WHERE ce.type = 2
    GROUP BY ce.claim_key_id
)
```

**Business Justification**: 
- **Required**: Report needs to show up to 5 resubmission cycles per claim
- **Problem Solved**: Multiple `LEFT JOIN`s (r1-r5) were creating Cartesian products
- **Benefit**: Captures complete resubmission history while preventing duplicates

#### **2. Remittance Cycles Aggregation**
```sql
remittance_cycles_aggregated AS (
    SELECT 
        rc.claim_key_id,
        (ARRAY_AGG(rc.date_settlement ORDER BY rc.date_settlement))[1] as first_ra_date,
        (ARRAY_AGG(rc.payment_amount ORDER BY rc.date_settlement))[1] as first_ra_amount,
        -- ... up to 5 cycles
    FROM claims.remittance_claim rc
    GROUP BY rc.claim_key_id
)
```

**Business Justification**:
- **Required**: Report tracks multiple remittance cycles per claim
- **Problem Solved**: Multiple `LEFT JOIN`s (rm1-rm5) were causing duplicates
- **Benefit**: Shows complete payment history without row multiplication

#### **3. Diagnosis Aggregation**
```sql
diag_agg AS (
    SELECT 
        c.id as claim_id,
        MAX(CASE WHEN d.diag_type = 'Principal' THEN d.code END) as primary_diagnosis,
        STRING_AGG(CASE WHEN d.diag_type = 'Secondary' THEN d.code END, ', ' ORDER BY d.code) as secondary_diagnosis
    FROM claims.claim c
    LEFT JOIN claims.diagnosis d ON c.id = d.claim_id
    GROUP BY c.id
)
```

**Business Justification**:
- **Required**: Report needs both principal and secondary diagnoses
- **Problem Solved**: Multiple secondary diagnoses were creating Cartesian products (9 rows for 1 claim)
- **Benefit**: Single row per claim with all diagnosis information properly formatted

### **Impact Analysis**
- **Before Fix**: 9 duplicate rows per (claim_key_id, activity_id) due to multiple secondary diagnoses
- **After Fix**: 1 row per (claim_key_id, activity_id) with complete information
- **Performance**: Eliminated Cartesian products, improved query performance
- **Data Integrity**: Maintains all required information while preventing duplicates

## 2. mv_claim_summary_payerwise

### **Report Purpose**
Payer-wise summary of claims with aggregated financial metrics and remittance information.

### **Aggregations Applied**

#### **Remittance Aggregation**
```sql
remittance_aggregated AS (
    SELECT 
        rc.claim_key_id,
        SUM(rc.payment_amount) as total_payment_amount,
        MAX(rc.date_settlement) as latest_settlement_date,
        COUNT(*) as remittance_count,
        STRING_AGG(DISTINCT rc.payment_reference, ', ' ORDER BY rc.payment_reference) as payment_references
    FROM claims.remittance_claim rc
    GROUP BY rc.claim_key_id
)
```

**Business Justification**:
- **Required**: Report needs aggregated remittance data per claim for payer analysis
- **Problem Solved**: Multiple remittance records per claim were creating duplicate rows
- **Benefit**: Single row per claim with complete remittance summary

### **Key Metrics Aggregated**
- `total_payment_amount`: Sum of all payments received for the claim
- `latest_settlement_date`: Most recent settlement date
- `remittance_count`: Number of remittance transactions
- `payment_references`: All payment reference numbers (comma-separated)

### **Impact Analysis**
- **Before Fix**: Multiple rows per claim due to multiple remittances
- **After Fix**: One row per claim with aggregated remittance data
- **Business Value**: Accurate payer-wise financial reporting
- **Performance**: Eliminated duplicate processing in downstream reports

## 3. mv_claim_summary_encounterwise

### **Report Purpose**
Encounter-wise summary of claims with facility and encounter-level aggregations.

### **Aggregations Applied**

#### **Remittance Aggregation** (Same as payerwise)
```sql
remittance_aggregated AS (
    SELECT 
        rc.claim_key_id,
        SUM(rc.payment_amount) as total_payment_amount,
        MAX(rc.date_settlement) as latest_settlement_date,
        COUNT(*) as remittance_count,
        STRING_AGG(DISTINCT rc.payment_reference, ', ' ORDER BY rc.payment_reference) as payment_references
    FROM claims.remittance_claim rc
    GROUP BY rc.claim_key_id
)
```

**Business Justification**:
- **Required**: Encounter-level reports need aggregated remittance data
- **Problem Solved**: Multiple remittances per claim were duplicating encounter records
- **Benefit**: Clean encounter-wise reporting with complete financial picture

### **Key Metrics Aggregated**
- Same as payerwise report but focused on encounter-level analysis
- Facility-level financial summaries
- Encounter type-based aggregations

### **Impact Analysis**
- **Before Fix**: Duplicate encounter records due to multiple remittances
- **After Fix**: One row per encounter with complete remittance summary
- **Business Value**: Accurate facility and encounter-level reporting
- **Performance**: Improved query performance for encounter-based analytics

## 4. mv_doctor_denial_summary

### **Report Purpose**
Doctor-wise summary of denials with aggregated denial reasons and financial impact.

### **Aggregations Applied**

#### **Denial Aggregation**
```sql
denial_aggregated AS (
    SELECT 
        a.clinician_ref_id,
        COUNT(DISTINCT a.claim_id) as denied_claims_count,
        SUM(a.net) as total_denied_amount,
        STRING_AGG(DISTINCT ra.denial_code, ', ' ORDER BY ra.denial_code) as denial_codes,
        COUNT(DISTINCT ra.denial_code) as unique_denial_count
    FROM claims.activity a
    JOIN claims.remittance_activity ra ON a.activity_id = ra.activity_id
    WHERE ra.denial_code IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY a.clinician_ref_id
)
```

**Business Justification**:
- **Required**: Doctor-level denial analysis needs aggregated denial data
- **Problem Solved**: Multiple denials per doctor were creating duplicate rows
- **Benefit**: Single row per doctor with complete denial summary

### **Key Metrics Aggregated**
- `denied_claims_count`: Number of unique claims denied
- `total_denied_amount`: Total financial impact of denials
- `denial_codes`: All denial codes (comma-separated)
- `unique_denial_count`: Number of different denial types

### **Impact Analysis**
- **Before Fix**: Multiple rows per doctor due to multiple denials
- **After Fix**: One row per doctor with aggregated denial data
- **Business Value**: Clear doctor performance metrics for denial management
- **Performance**: Efficient doctor-wise denial reporting
