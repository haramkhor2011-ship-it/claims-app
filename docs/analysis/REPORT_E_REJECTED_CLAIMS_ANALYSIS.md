## Data Flow Analysis

### Complete Data Journey
1. **Ingestion**: `ClaimXmlParserStax` → XML parsing and validation
2. **Persistence**: `PersistService` → `claims.claim`, `claims.activity`, `claims.encounter`
3. **Summary Computation**: `claim_payment_functions.sql` → `claim_activity_summary` population
4. **Reporting Layer**: Base view → Tab views → API functions
5. **API Layer**: `RejectedClaimsReportService` → API functions
6. **Controller**: `ReportDataController` → REST endpoints

### Key Data Transformations
- **Rejection Analysis**: Activity-level rejection tracking
- **Aging Calculation**: Time-based aging analysis
- **Denial Code Resolution**: Reference data resolution
- **Status Mapping**: Rejection type determination

## Cumulative-With-Cap Logic Implementation

### ✅ Correct Implementation
**Location**: Lines 150, 106-108 in `rejected_claims_report_final.sql`

```sql
LEFT JOIN claims.claim_activity_summary cas ON cas.claim_key_id = ck.id AND cas.activity_id = a.activity_id

-- Remittance details (CUMULATIVE-WITH-CAP: Using pre-computed activity summary)
-- WHY: Prevents overcounting from multiple remittances per activity, uses latest denial logic
-- HOW: Leverages claims.claim_activity_summary which already implements cumulative-with-cap semantics
COALESCE(cas.paid_amount, 0) AS activity_payment_amount,                    -- capped paid across remittances
(cas.denial_codes)[1] AS activity_denial_code,                             -- latest denial from pre-computed summary
COALESCE(dc.description, (cas.denial_codes)[1], 'No Denial Code') AS denial_type,
```

### Key Features
- **Line 109**: `COALESCE(cas.paid_amount, 0)` - capped paid across remittances
- **Line 110**: `(cas.denial_codes)[1]` - latest denial from pre-computed summary
- **Line 111**: `COALESCE(dc.description, (cas.denial_codes)[1], 'No Denial Code')` - denial type resolution
- **Line 114**: Uses `cas.activity_status` for rejection type mapping

### Latest Denial Semantics
- **Implementation**: Uses `(cas.denial_codes)[1]` for most recent denial
- **Business Rationale**: Only current denial status matters for operational decisions

## Business Logic Verification

### Rejection Type Mapping
**Logic**: Maps activity status to rejection type

```sql
CASE
    WHEN cas.activity_status = 'REJECTED' THEN 'REJECTED'
    WHEN cas.activity_status = 'PARTIALLY_PAID' THEN 'PARTIALLY_PAID'
    WHEN cas.activity_status = 'PENDING' THEN 'PENDING'
    ELSE 'UNKNOWN'
END AS rejection_type
```

### Rejected Amount Calculation
**Logic**: Only counts as rejected when latest denial exists AND capped paid = 0

```sql
-- Rejected amount (CUMULATIVE-WITH-CAP: Using pre-computed denied amount)
-- WHY: Only counts as rejected when latest denial exists AND capped paid = 0
-- HOW: Uses cas.denied_amount which implements the latest-denial-and-zero-paid logic
COALESCE(cas.denied_amount, 0) AS rejected_amount
```

### Aging Calculation
**Logic**: Uses encounter start date for aging

```sql
EXTRACT(DAYS FROM (CURRENT_DATE - e.start_at)) AS aging_days,
CASE
    WHEN EXTRACT(DAYS FROM (CURRENT_DATE - e.start_at)) <= 30 THEN '0-30'
    WHEN EXTRACT(DAYS FROM (CURRENT_DATE - e.start_at)) <= 60 THEN '31-60'
    WHEN EXTRACT(DAYS FROM (CURRENT_DATE - e.start_at)) <= 90 THEN '61-90'
    ELSE '90+'
END AS aging_bucket
```

### Denial Code Analysis
**Logic**: Uses latest denial code with reference data resolution

```sql
COALESCE(dc.description, (cas.denial_codes)[1], 'No Denial Code') AS denial_type,
COALESCE(dc.category, 'Unknown') AS denial_category
```

## Naming Convention Compliance

### ✅ Perfect Compliance
- **Views**: `v_rejected_claims_*` ✅
- **Functions**: `get_rejected_claims_*` ✅
- **Indexes**: `mv_rejected_claims_*` ✅
- **MVs**: `mv_rejected_claims_*` ✅

### Pattern Verification
- All views follow `v_*` pattern
- All functions follow `get_*` pattern
- All indexes follow `mv_*` pattern
- All MVs follow `mv_*` pattern

## Java Integration Analysis

### Service Layer
**File**: `src/main/java/com/acme/claims/service/RejectedClaimsReportService.java`

#### Key Methods
- `getRejectedClaimsSummary()` - Summary metrics
- `getRejectedClaimsReceiverPayer()` - Receiver/payer analysis
- `getRejectedClaimsClaimWise()` - Claim-wise details

#### Parameter Mapping
```java
String sql = """
    SELECT * FROM claims.get_rejected_claims_summary(
        p_use_mv := ?,
        p_tab_name := ?,
        p_facility_codes := ?,
        p_payer_codes := ?,
        p_receiver_ids := ?,
        p_from_date := ?,
        p_to_date := ?,
        p_year := ?,
        p_month := ?,
        p_limit := ?,
        p_offset := ?
    )
""";
```

#### Performance Optimization
- **MV Toggle**: Uses `is_mv_enabled` toggle for performance optimization
- **Tab-Specific Functions**: Different functions for each tab
- **Proper Grouping**: Correct GROUP BY clauses for each tab

### Controller Integration
**File**: `src/main/java/com/acme/claims/controller/ReportDataController.java`

- Accessible via REST endpoints
- Proper parameter validation
- User access control

## Performance Characteristics

### Materialized View Strategy
- **Tab-Specific MVs**: Individual MVs for each tab optimization
- **General MV**: `mv_rejected_claims_summary` for general performance
- **Index Strategy**: 6 performance indexes with proper covering

### Query Optimization

## Verification Recommendations

### Cumulative-With-Cap Verification
```sql
-- Verify that claim_activity_summary is being used correctly
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    viewname,
    definition
FROM pg_views 
WHERE schemaname = 'claims' 
  AND viewname LIKE 'v_rejected_claims_%'
  AND definition LIKE '%SUM(ra.payment_amount)%'
  AND definition NOT LIKE '%claim_activity_summary%';

-- Expected: No results (all views should use claim_activity_summary)
```

### Business Logic Verification
```sql
-- Verify that rejection type mapping is correct
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    viewname,
    definition
FROM pg_views 
WHERE schemaname = 'claims' 
  AND viewname LIKE 'v_rejected_claims_%'
  AND definition LIKE '%rejection_type%'
  AND definition NOT LIKE '%cas.activity_status%';

-- Expected: No results (rejection type should use activity status)
```

### Performance Verification
```sql
-- Verify materialized view refresh status
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    matviewname,
    hasindexes,
    ispopulated
FROM pg_matviews 
WHERE schemaname = 'claims'
  AND matviewname LIKE 'mv_rejected_claims_%';

-- Expected: All MVs should be populated (ispopulated = true)
```

### Edge Case Scenarios Testing
```sql
-- Test edge cases for rejected claims report
-- 1. Claims with rejection type but zero rejected amount
SELECT 
    claim_key_id,
    activity_id,
    rejection_type,
    rejected_amount,
    activity_payment_amount
FROM claims.v_rejected_claims_base
WHERE rejection_type = 'REJECTED'
  AND rejected_amount = 0
  AND activity_payment_amount = 0;

-- Expected: Limited results (some rejections may legitimately have zero amounts)

-- 2. Claims with inconsistent aging calculations
SELECT 
    claim_key_id,
    encounter_start,
    aging_days,
    aging_bucket
FROM claims.v_rejected_claims_base
WHERE encounter_start IS NULL
  AND aging_days IS NOT NULL;

-- Expected: No results (aging should be NULL when encounter_start is NULL)

-- 3. Claims with denial codes but no denial type
SELECT 
    claim_key_id,
    activity_id,
    activity_denial_code,
    denial_type
FROM claims.v_rejected_claims_base
WHERE activity_denial_code IS NOT NULL
  AND denial_type = 'No Denial Code';

-- Expected: Limited results (some denial codes may not have reference data)

-- 4. Claims with negative rejected amounts
SELECT 
    claim_key_id,
    activity_id,
    rejected_amount,
    activity_net_amount
FROM claims.v_rejected_claims_base
WHERE rejected_amount < 0;

-- Expected: No results (rejected amounts should not be negative)

-- 5. Claims with payment amount exceeding net amount
SELECT 
    claim_key_id,
    activity_id,
    activity_payment_amount,
    activity_net_amount,
    rejection_type
FROM claims.v_rejected_claims_base
WHERE activity_payment_amount > activity_net_amount
  AND rejection_type = 'REJECTED';

-- Expected: No results (rejected claims should not have overpayments)
```

### Data Consistency Verification
```sql
-- Verify that cumulative-with-cap logic prevents overcounting
WITH raw_aggregation AS (
    SELECT 
        ck.id as claim_key_id,
        a.activity_id,
        SUM(ra.payment_amount) as raw_total_paid
    FROM claims.claim_key ck
    JOIN claims.claim c ON c.claim_key_id = ck.id
    JOIN claims.activity a ON a.claim_id = c.id
    JOIN claims.remittance_claim rc ON rc.claim_key_id = ck.id
    JOIN claims.remittance_activity ra ON ra.remittance_claim_id = rc.id 
        AND ra.activity_id = a.activity_id
    GROUP BY ck.id, a.activity_id
),
capped_aggregation AS (
    SELECT 
        claim_key_id,
        activity_id,
        paid_amount as capped_total_paid
    FROM claims.claim_activity_summary
)
SELECT 
    r.claim_key_id,
    r.activity_id,
    r.raw_total_paid,
    c.capped_total_paid,
    (r.raw_total_paid - c.capped_total_paid) as overcounting_amount
FROM raw_aggregation r
JOIN capped_aggregation c ON r.claim_key_id = c.claim_key_id 
    AND r.activity_id = c.activity_id
WHERE r.raw_total_paid > c.capped_total_paid;

-- Expected: No results (capped should prevent overcounting)
```

### Rejection Type Verification
```sql
-- Verify that rejection type mapping is consistent
SELECT 
    activity_status,
    rejection_type,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM claims.v_rejected_claims_base
GROUP BY activity_status, rejection_type
ORDER BY activity_status, rejection_type;

-- Expected: Consistent mapping between activity_status and rejection_type
```

### Aging Bucket Verification
```sql
-- Verify that aging buckets are correctly calculated
SELECT 
    aging_days,
    aging_bucket,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM claims.v_rejected_claims_base
WHERE aging_days IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY aging_days, aging_bucket
HAVING 
    (aging_days <= 30 AND aging_bucket != '0-30') OR
    (aging_days > 30 AND aging_days <= 60 AND aging_bucket != '31-60') OR
    (aging_days > 60 AND aging_days <= 90 AND aging_bucket != '61-90') OR
    (aging_days > 90 AND aging_bucket != '90+');

-- Expected: No results (aging buckets should match aging days)
```

### Denial Code Reference Verification
```sql
-- Verify that denial codes have proper reference data resolution
SELECT 
    activity_denial_code,
    denial_type,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM claims.v_rejected_claims_base
WHERE activity_denial_code IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY activity_denial_code, denial_type
HAVING denial_type = 'No Denial Code';

-- Expected: Limited results (some denial codes may not have reference data)
```
