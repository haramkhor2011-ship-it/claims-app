## Data Flow Analysis

### Complete Data Journey
1. **Ingestion**: `ClaimXmlParserStax` → XML parsing and validation
2. **Persistence**: `PersistService` → `claims.claim`, `claims.activity`, `claims.encounter`
3. **Summary Computation**: `claim_payment_functions.sql` → `claim_activity_summary` population
4. **Reporting Layer**: Main view → API function
5. **API Layer**: `ClaimDetailsWithActivityReportService` → `get_claim_details_with_activity()`
6. **Controller**: `ReportDataController` → REST endpoints

### Key Data Transformations
- **Activity-Level Aggregation**: Individual activity financial tracking
- **Status Resolution**: Latest status from timeline
- **Reference Data Resolution**: Clinician, activity code, diagnosis resolution
- **Financial Calculations**: Collection rate, denial rate, turnaround time

## Cumulative-With-Cap Logic Implementation

### ✅ Correct Implementation
**Location**: Lines 142-150 in `claim_details_with_activity_final.sql`

```sql
-- Financial Calculations (CUMULATIVE-WITH-CAP: Using pre-computed activity summary)
COALESCE(cas.paid_amount, 0) as remitted_amount,                    -- capped paid across remittances
COALESCE(cas.paid_amount, 0) as settled_amount,                    -- same as remitted for this report
COALESCE(cas.rejected_amount, 0) as rejected_amount,               -- rejected only when latest denial and zero paid
COALESCE(cas.submitted_amount, 0) - COALESCE(cas.paid_amount, 0) - COALESCE(cas.denied_amount, 0) as unprocessed_amount,
COALESCE(cas.denied_amount, 0) as initial_rejected_amount,         -- denied amount from latest denial logic

-- Denial Information (CUMULATIVE-WITH-CAP: Using latest denial from activity summary)
(cas.denial_codes)[1] as last_denial_code,  -- first element of denial codes array (latest)
```

### Key Features
- **Line 143**: `COALESCE(cas.paid_amount, 0)` - capped paid across remittances
- **Line 145**: `COALESCE(cas.rejected_amount, 0)` - rejected only when latest denial and zero paid
- **Line 150**: `(cas.denial_codes)[1]` - latest denial from pre-computed summary
- **Line 222**: Proper JOIN to `claim_activity_summary` with `claim_key_id` and `activity_id`

### Latest Denial Semantics
- **Implementation**: Uses `(cas.denial_codes)[1]` for most recent denial
- **Business Rationale**: Only current denial status matters for operational decisions

## Business Logic Verification

### Financial Calculations
**Collection Rate**: `(paid_amount / submitted_amount) * 100` with NULL handling

```sql
CASE
    WHEN COALESCE(cas.submitted_amount, 0) > 0 THEN
        ROUND((COALESCE(cas.paid_amount, 0) / cas.submitted_amount) * 100, 2)
    ELSE 0
END as collection_rate
```

### Turnaround Time
**Formula**: `EXTRACT(DAYS FROM (remittance_date - submission_date))`

```sql
CASE
    WHEN rc.date_settlement IS NOT NULL AND c.tx_at IS NOT NULL THEN
        EXTRACT(DAYS FROM (rc.date_settlement - c.tx_at))
    ELSE NULL
END as turnaround_time_days
```

### Payment Status Logic
**Status Determination**: Based on activity status and financial amounts

```sql
CASE
    WHEN cas.activity_status = 'FULLY_PAID' THEN 'Fully Paid'
    WHEN cas.activity_status = 'PARTIALLY_PAID' THEN 'Partially Paid'
    WHEN cas.activity_status = 'REJECTED' THEN 'Rejected'
    WHEN cas.activity_status = 'PENDING' THEN 'Pending'
    ELSE 'Unknown'
END as payment_status
```

### Unprocessed Amount Calculation
**Formula**: `submitted_amount - paid_amount - denied_amount`

```sql
COALESCE(cas.submitted_amount, 0) - COALESCE(cas.paid_amount, 0) - COALESCE(cas.denied_amount, 0) as unprocessed_amount
```

## Naming Convention Compliance

### ✅ Perfect Compliance

## Verification Recommendations

### Cumulative-With-Cap Verification
```sql
-- Verify that claim_activity_summary is being used correctly
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    viewname,
    definition
FROM pg_views 
WHERE schemaname = 'claims' 
  AND viewname LIKE 'v_claim_details_%'
  AND definition LIKE '%SUM(ra.payment_amount)%'
  AND definition NOT LIKE '%claim_activity_summary%';

-- Expected: No results (all views should use claim_activity_summary)
```

### Business Logic Verification
```sql
-- Verify that collection rate calculation is correct
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    viewname,
    definition
FROM pg_views 
WHERE schemaname = 'claims' 
  AND viewname LIKE 'v_claim_details_%'
  AND definition LIKE '%collection_rate%'
  AND definition NOT LIKE '%cas.submitted_amount%';

-- Expected: No results (collection rate should use activity summary)
```

### Performance Verification
```sql
-- Verify materialized view refresh status
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    matviewname,
    hasindexes,
    ispopulated
FROM pg_matviews 
WHERE schemaname = 'claims'
  AND matviewname LIKE 'mv_claim_details_%';

-- Expected: All MVs should be populated (ispopulated = true)
```

### Edge Case Scenarios Testing
```sql
-- Test edge cases for claim details with activity
-- 1. Activities with zero submitted amount but non-zero collection rate
SELECT 
    claim_key_id,
    activity_id,
    submitted_amount,
    paid_amount,
    collection_rate
FROM claims.v_claim_details_with_activity
WHERE submitted_amount = 0
  AND collection_rate > 0;

-- Expected: No results (collection rate should be 0 when submitted amount is 0)

-- 2. Activities with turnaround time calculation issues
SELECT 
    claim_key_id,
    activity_id,
    submission_date,
    remittance_date,
    turnaround_time_days
FROM claims.v_claim_details_with_activity
WHERE submission_date IS NOT NULL
  AND remittance_date IS NOT NULL
  AND turnaround_time_days < 0;

-- Expected: No results (turnaround time should not be negative)

-- 3. Activities with inconsistent payment status
SELECT 
    claim_key_id,
    activity_id,
    payment_status,
    paid_amount,
    submitted_amount,
    denied_amount
FROM claims.v_claim_details_with_activity
WHERE payment_status = 'Fully Paid'
  AND (paid_amount < submitted_amount OR denied_amount > 0);

-- Expected: No results (fully paid should have paid_amount >= submitted_amount and denied_amount = 0)

-- 4. Activities with missing reference data
SELECT 
    claim_key_id,
    activity_id,
    clinician,
    activity_code,
    diagnosis_code
FROM claims.v_claim_details_with_activity
WHERE clinician IS NULL
  AND activity_code IS NULL
  AND diagnosis_code IS NULL;

-- Expected: Limited results (some activities may legitimately have missing reference data)
```

### Data Consistency Verification
```sql
-- Verify that cumulative-with-cap logic prevents overcounting
WITH raw_aggregation AS (
    SELECT 
        ck.id as claim_key_id,
        a.activity_id,
        SUM(ra.payment_amount) as raw_total_paid
    FROM claims.claim_key ck
    JOIN claims.claim c ON c.claim_key_id = ck.id
    JOIN claims.activity a ON a.claim_id = c.id
    JOIN claims.remittance_claim rc ON rc.claim_key_id = ck.id
    JOIN claims.remittance_activity ra ON ra.remittance_claim_id = rc.id 
        AND ra.activity_id = a.activity_id
    GROUP BY ck.id, a.activity_id
),
capped_aggregation AS (
    SELECT 
        claim_key_id,
        activity_id,
        paid_amount as capped_total_paid
    FROM claims.claim_activity_summary
)
SELECT 
    r.claim_key_id,
    r.activity_id,
    r.raw_total_paid,
    c.capped_total_paid,
    (r.raw_total_paid - c.capped_total_paid) as overcounting_amount
FROM raw_aggregation r
JOIN capped_aggregation c ON r.claim_key_id = c.claim_key_id 
    AND r.activity_id = c.activity_id
WHERE r.raw_total_paid > c.capped_total_paid;

-- Expected: No results (capped should prevent overcounting)
```

### Latest Denial Semantics Verification
```sql
-- Verify that latest denial semantics are correctly implemented
SELECT 
    claim_key_id,
    activity_id,
    last_denial_code,
    denial_codes_array
FROM claims.v_claim_details_with_activity
WHERE denial_codes_array IS NOT NULL
  AND array_length(denial_codes_array, 1) > 1
  AND last_denial_code != (denial_codes_array)[1];

-- Expected: No results (last_denial_code should match first element of denial_codes_array)
```
