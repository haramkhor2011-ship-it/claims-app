## Report Overview

### Business Purpose
Remittance reconciliation with three complementary tabs for different business scenarios:
- **Tab A (Header)**: Remittance header information and summary
- **Tab B (Claim Wise)**: Claim-level remittance details
- **Tab C (Activity Wise)**: Activity-level remittance details

### Use Cases
- Remittance reconciliation
- Payment verification
- Payer performance analysis
- Financial reconciliation
- Audit trail maintenance

## Technical Architecture

### Underlying Database Objects

#### Views
- `claims.v_remittance_advice_header` (Tab A)
- `claims.v_remittance_advice_claim_wise` (Tab B)
- `claims.v_remittance_advice_activity_wise` (Tab C)

#### Functions
- `claims.get_remittance_advice_header()` (header API function)
- `claims.get_remittance_advice_claim_wise()` (claim-wise API function)
- `claims.get_remittance_advice_activity_wise()` (activity-wise API function)

#### Materialized Views
- `claims.mv_remittance_advice_summary` (performance optimization)
- `claims.mv_remittance_advice_header` (Tab A optimization)
- `claims.mv_remittance_advice_claim_wise` (Tab B optimization)
- `claims.mv_remittance_advice_activity_wise` (Tab C optimization)

#### Indexes
- `idx_remittance_advice_header`
- `idx_remittance_advice_claim`
- `idx_remittance_advice_activity`
- `idx_remittance_advice_payer`
- `idx_remittance_advice_facility`

## Data Flow Analysis

### Complete Data Journey
1. **Ingestion**: `ClaimXmlParserStax` → XML parsing and validation
2. **Persistence**: `PersistService` → `claims.remittance`, `claims.remittance_claim`, `claims.remittance_activity`
3. **Summary Computation**: `claim_payment_functions.sql` → `claim_activity_summary` population
4. **Reporting Layer**: Tab views → API functions
5. **API Layer**: `RemittanceAdvicePayerwiseReportService` → API functions
6. **Controller**: `ReportDataController` → REST endpoints

### Key Data Transformations
- **Remittance Aggregation**: Header-level financial aggregation
- **Claim-Level Analysis**: Individual claim remittance tracking
- **Activity-Level Analysis**: Activity-specific remittance tracking
- **Reference Data Resolution**: Payer, facility resolution

## Cumulative-With-Cap Logic Implementation

### ✅ Correct Implementation
**Location**: Multiple locations in `remittance_advice_payerwise_report_final.sql`

#### Tab A (Header) - Lines 54, 42-44
```sql
JOIN claims.claim_activity_summary cas ON cas.claim_key_id = rc.claim_key_id

-- CUMULATIVE-WITH-CAP: Pre-aggregate activities using claim_activity_summary
-- WHY: Prevents overcounting from multiple remittances per activity, uses latest denial logic
-- HOW: Leverages claims.claim_activity_summary which already implements cumulative-with-cap semantics
SELECT 
    rc.id as remittance_claim_id,
    COUNT(cas.activity_id) as activity_count,
    SUM(cas.paid_amount) as total_paid,
    SUM(cas.denied_amount) as total_denied,
    ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT 
        CASE WHEN cas.denial_codes IS NOT NULL 
        THEN UNNEST(cas.denial_codes) 
        END) as denial_codes
FROM UNNEST(cas.denial_codes) AS denial_code) as denial_codes  -- flatten denial codes array
```

#### Tab B (Claim Wise) - Lines 197, 166-168
```sql
LEFT JOIN claims.claim_activity_summary cas ON cas.claim_key_id = ck.id

-- Financial Information (CUMULATIVE-WITH-CAP: Using pre-computed activity summary)
-- WHY: Prevents overcounting from multiple remittances per activity, uses latest denial logic
-- HOW: Leverages claims.claim_activity_summary which already implements cumulative-with-cap semantics
COALESCE(c.net, 0) AS claim_amount,
COALESCE(SUM(cas.paid_amount), 0) AS remittance_amount,                    -- capped paid across remittances
COALESCE(SUM(cas.denied_amount), 0) AS denied_amount,                     -- denied only when latest denial and zero paid
```

#### Tab C (Activity Wise) - Lines 286, 232-234
```sql
LEFT JOIN claims.claim_activity_summary cas ON cas.claim_key_id = rc.claim_key_id AND cas.activity_id = ra.activity_id

-- CUMULATIVE-WITH-CAP: Using pre-computed activity summary
-- WHY: Prevents overcounting from multiple remittances per activity, uses latest denial logic
-- HOW: Leverages claims.claim_activity_summary which already implements cumulative-with-cap semantics
COALESCE(cas.paid_amount, 0) AS payment_amount,                    -- capped paid across remittances

-- Denial Information (CUMULATIVE-WITH-CAP: Using latest denial from activity summary)
COALESCE((cas.denial_codes)[1], '') AS denial_code,                -- latest denial from pre-computed summary
```

### Key Features
- **All Three Tabs**: Use `claim_activity_summary` consistently
- **Explicit Comments**: Clear CUMULATIVE-WITH-CAP documentation
- **No Raw Aggregations**: No direct aggregations over `remittance_activity`
- **Latest Denial Logic**: Uses pre-computed activity status

## Business Logic Verification

### Financial Aggregation
**Logic**: Uses pre-computed activity summary for accuracy

```sql
-- Aggregated Metrics (CUMULATIVE-WITH-CAP: Using pre-computed activity summary)
COUNT(cas.activity_id) AS activity_count,                                 -- count of activities with remittance data
SUM(COALESCE(cas.paid_amount, 0)) AS total_paid,                         -- capped paid across remittances
SUM(COALESCE(cas.denied_amount, 0)) AS total_denied,                     -- denied only when latest denial and zero paid
```

### Payment Percentage Calculation
**Formula**: `(paid_amount / claim_amount) * 100`

```sql
-- Calculated Fields (CUMULATIVE-WITH-CAP: Using pre-computed activity summary)
ROUND(
    CASE
        WHEN COALESCE(c.net, 0) > 0 THEN
            (COALESCE(SUM(cas.paid_amount), 0) / c.net) * 100
        ELSE 0
    END, 2
) AS payment_percentage
```

### Payment Status Determination
**Logic**: Based on activity status and financial amounts

```sql
-- Payment Status (CUMULATIVE-WITH-CAP: Using pre-computed activity status)
CASE
    WHEN cas.activity_status = 'REJECTED' THEN 'DENIED'
    WHEN cas.activity_status = 'FULLY_PAID' THEN 'FULLY_PAID'
    WHEN cas.activity_status = 'PARTIALLY_PAID' THEN 'PARTIALLY_PAID'
    WHEN cas.activity_status = 'PENDING' THEN 'PENDING'
    ELSE 'UNKNOWN'
END AS payment_status
```

### Unit Price Calculation
**Formula**: `payment_amount / quantity`

```sql
-- Unit Price Calculation (CUMULATIVE-WITH-CAP: Using pre-computed activity summary)
ROUND(
    CASE
        WHEN COALESCE(act.quantity, 0) > 0 THEN
            COALESCE(cas.paid_amount, 0) / act.quantity
        ELSE 0
    END, 2
) AS unit_price
```

## Naming Convention Compliance

### ✅ Perfect Compliance
- **Views**: `v_remittance_advice_*` ✅
- **Functions**: `get_remittance_advice_*` ✅
- **Indexes**: `idx_remittance_advice_*` ✅
- **MVs**: `mv_remittance_advice_*` ✅

### Pattern Verification
- All views follow `v_*` pattern
- All functions follow `get_*` pattern
- All indexes follow `idx_*` pattern
- All MVs follow `mv_*` pattern

## Java Integration Analysis

### Service Layer
**File**: `src/main/java/com/acme/claims/service/RemittanceAdvicePayerwiseReportService.java`

#### Key Methods
- `getRemittanceAdviceHeader()` - Tab A implementation
- `getRemittanceAdviceClaimWise()` - Tab B implementation
- `getRemittanceAdviceActivityWise()` - Tab C implementation

#### Parameter Mapping
```java
String sql = """
    SELECT * FROM claims.get_remittance_advice_header(
        p_use_mv := ?,
        p_tab_name := ?,
        p_facility_codes := ?,
        p_payer_codes := ?,
        p_receiver_ids := ?,
        p_from_date := ?,
        p_to_date := ?,
        p_year := ?,
        p_month := ?,
        p_limit := ?,
        p_offset := ?
    )
""";
```

#### Performance Optimization

## Verification Recommendations

### Cumulative-With-Cap Verification
```sql
-- Verify that claim_activity_summary is being used correctly
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    viewname,
    definition
FROM pg_views 
WHERE schemaname = 'claims' 
  AND viewname LIKE 'v_remittance_advice_%'
  AND definition LIKE '%SUM(ra.payment_amount)%'
  AND definition NOT LIKE '%claim_activity_summary%';

-- Expected: No results (all views should use claim_activity_summary)
```

### Business Logic Verification
```sql
-- Verify that payment percentage calculation is correct
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    viewname,
    definition
FROM pg_views 
WHERE schemaname = 'claims' 
  AND viewname LIKE 'v_remittance_advice_%'
  AND definition LIKE '%payment_percentage%'
  AND definition NOT LIKE '%cas.paid_amount%';

-- Expected: No results (payment percentage should use activity summary)
```

### Performance Verification
```sql
-- Verify materialized view refresh status
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    matviewname,
    hasindexes,
    ispopulated
FROM pg_matviews 
WHERE schemaname = 'claims'
  AND matviewname LIKE 'mv_remittance_advice_%';

-- Expected: All MVs should be populated (ispopulated = true)
```

### Edge Case Scenarios Testing
```sql
-- Test edge cases for remittance advice payerwise
-- 1. Claims with zero claim amount but non-zero payment percentage
SELECT 
    claim_key_id,
    claim_amount,
    remittance_amount,
    payment_percentage
FROM claims.v_remittance_advice_claim_wise
WHERE claim_amount = 0
  AND payment_percentage > 0;

-- Expected: No results (payment percentage should be 0 when claim amount is 0)

-- 2. Activities with payment amount exceeding net amount
SELECT 
    claim_key_id,
    activity_id,
    net_amount,
    payment_amount,
    payment_status
FROM claims.v_remittance_advice_activity_wise
WHERE payment_amount > net_amount
  AND payment_status = 'DENIED';

-- Expected: No results (denied activities should not have overpayments)

-- 3. Remittances with missing payer data
SELECT 
    remittance_id,
    payer_code,
    payer_name,
    total_paid
FROM claims.v_remittance_advice_header
WHERE payer_code IS NULL
  AND total_paid > 0;

-- Expected: Limited results (some remittances may legitimately have missing payer data)

-- 4. Activities with inconsistent unit price calculations
SELECT 
    claim_key_id,
    activity_id,
    quantity,
    net_amount,
    payment_amount,
    unit_price
FROM claims.v_remittance_advice_activity_wise
WHERE quantity > 0
  AND net_amount > 0
  AND unit_price = 0;

-- Expected: Limited results (some activities may legitimately have zero unit prices)

-- 5. Remittances with negative amounts
SELECT 
    remittance_id,
    total_paid,
    total_denied,
    activity_count
FROM claims.v_remittance_advice_header
WHERE total_paid < 0
   OR total_denied < 0;

-- Expected: No results (amounts should not be negative)
```

### Data Consistency Verification
```sql
-- Verify that cumulative-with-cap logic prevents overcounting
WITH raw_aggregation AS (
    SELECT 
        rc.id as remittance_claim_id,
        SUM(ra.payment_amount) as raw_total_paid
    FROM claims.remittance_claim rc
    JOIN claims.remittance_activity ra ON ra.remittance_claim_id = rc.id
    GROUP BY rc.id
),
capped_aggregation AS (
    SELECT 
        rc.id as remittance_claim_id,
        SUM(cas.paid_amount) as capped_total_paid
    FROM claims.remittance_claim rc
    JOIN claims.claim_activity_summary cas ON cas.claim_key_id = rc.claim_key_id
    GROUP BY rc.id
)
SELECT 
    r.remittance_claim_id,
    r.raw_total_paid,
    c.capped_total_paid,
    (r.raw_total_paid - c.capped_total_paid) as overcounting_amount
FROM raw_aggregation r
JOIN capped_aggregation c ON r.remittance_claim_id = c.remittance_claim_id
WHERE r.raw_total_paid > c.capped_total_paid;

-- Expected: No results (capped should prevent overcounting)
```

### Payment Status Verification
```sql
-- Verify that payment status is consistent with amounts
SELECT 
    claim_key_id,
    activity_id,
    payment_status,
    payment_amount,
    denied_amount,
    net_amount
FROM claims.v_remittance_advice_activity_wise
WHERE 
    (payment_status = 'FULLY_PAID' AND (payment_amount < net_amount OR denied_amount > 0)) OR
    (payment_status = 'DENIED' AND (payment_amount > 0 OR denied_amount = 0)) OR
    (payment_status = 'PARTIALLY_PAID' AND (payment_amount >= net_amount OR denied_amount > 0));

-- Expected: No results (payment status should be consistent with amounts)
```

### Unit Price Verification
```sql
-- Verify that unit price calculation is correct
SELECT 
    claim_key_id,
    activity_id,
    quantity,
    net_amount,
    payment_amount,
    unit_price,
    ROUND(payment_amount / NULLIF(quantity, 0), 2) as calculated_unit_price
FROM claims.v_remittance_advice_activity_wise
WHERE quantity > 0
  AND ABS(unit_price - ROUND(payment_amount / quantity, 2)) > 0.01;

-- Expected: No results (unit price should match calculated value)
```

### Denial Code Verification
```sql
-- Verify that denial codes are properly resolved
SELECT 
    claim_key_id,
    activity_id,
    denial_code,
    payment_status
FROM claims.v_remittance_advice_activity_wise
WHERE denial_code IS NOT NULL
  AND payment_status != 'DENIED';

-- Expected: Limited results (some activities may have denial codes but not be fully denied)
```
