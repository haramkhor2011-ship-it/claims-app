# Diagnosis Code Join Implementation Summary

## Overview
Updated views to properly join to `claims_ref.diagnosis_code` to get diagnosis descriptions, handling both cases where diagnosis codes may have `diagnosis_code_ref_id` (preferred) or only have raw `code` values.

## Implementation Details

### Join Strategy
Used **LATERAL joins** to safely handle both scenarios:

```sql
LEFT JOIN LATERAL (
  SELECT description FROM claims_ref.diagnosis_code 
  WHERE (d1.diagnosis_code_ref_id IS NOT NULL AND id = d1.diagnosis_code_ref_id)
     OR (d1.diagnosis_code_ref_id IS NULL AND code = d1.code)
  LIMIT 1
) dc_prim ON true
```

### How It Works
1. **Primary Path**: If `diagnosis_code_ref_id` exists (NOT NULL), join by `id = diagnosis_code_ref_id`
2. **Fallback Path**: If `diagnosis_code_ref_id` is NULL, join by `code = code`
3. **LATERAL join** ensures the subquery can reference columns from the outer query (`d1`)
4. **LIMIT 1** ensures only one row is returned per diagnosis
5. Safe: Won't error if column is NULL or missing

## Updated Views

### `v_claim_details_with_activity`
- Added diagnosis code description joins for both primary and secondary diagnoses
- Joins: `dc_prim` and `dc_sec`
- Provides both diagnosis codes and descriptions

## Indexes

The following indexes already exist and support this join pattern:

1. **`idx_diagnosis_code_ref`** on `claims.diagnosis(diagnosis_code_ref_id)` - for ID-based lookups
2. **`idx_diagnosis_code`** on `claims.diagnosis(code)` - for fallback code lookups
3. **`idx_diagnosis_code_lookup`** on `claims_ref.diagnosis_code(code, description)` - for reference table lookups

### Additional Indexes Created
Created `00-indexes-diagnosis-code.sql` with:
- `idx_diagnosis_by_code` - Partial index for code-only lookups
- `idx_diagnosis_claim_type_code` - Composite index for optimized filtering

## Data Flow

### For Claims with Ref IDs:
```
claims.diagnosis → claims_ref.diagnosis_code (by id) → description
```

### For Claims without Ref IDs:
```
claims.diagnosis → claims_ref.diagnosis_code (by code) → description
```

## Benefits

1. ✅ **No Errors**: LATERAL join handles NULL ref_id gracefully
2. ✅ **Performance**: Existing indexes support both join patterns
3. ✅ **Flexibility**: Works with or without reference IDs
4. ✅ **Completeness**: Always returns description when available in reference data

## Next Steps

Similar patterns should be applied to:
- Other views that reference diagnoses
- Materialized views (07-materialized-views.sql)
- Any functions that process diagnoses

## Testing

To verify the implementation works correctly:
1. Run the view query on sample data
2. Check that diagnosis descriptions are returned
3. Verify both scenarios (with and without ref_id) work
4. Monitor query performance

## Notes

- The diagnosis table has `diagnosis_code_ref_id BIGINT` column (nullable)
- There's NO foreign key constraint - so the join must be safe
- The pattern can be reused for other reference lookups (activity_code, denial_code, etc.)
